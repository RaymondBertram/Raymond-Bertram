              I am a software engineer specializing on full stack web and mobile
              app development. Currently I am focused on building innovative and
              sustainable technologies to enhance peoples lives. My journey
              started as a full stack developer where I build digital products
              in agile methodologies with technologies like
              JavaScript/Typescript, React, React Native, AWS, JEST and Node.
              Its not about the technologies but more about attitude and the
              mentality to get things done effectivly.
