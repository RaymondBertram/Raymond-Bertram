This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the codebase for my personal website, built using **React** and **Next.js** for server-side rendering and static site generation. The design is fully responsive and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a clean and modern UI across all devices. Smooth animations and transitions are powered by **Framer Motion**, enhancing the user experience with dynamic interactions. The site showcases my portfolio, skills, and projects while maintaining high performance and SEO optimization thanks to Next.js's powerful framework.

# Deployement

The website is deployed using Vercel, providing seamless integration with the Next.js framework for optimized build and deployment workflows. The domain is hosted and managed through Squarespace, allowing for easy DNS configuration and domain management. This setup ensures reliable uptime, fast load times, and effortless updates as I push changes directly through Vercel.
